    "\"Twirling is a technique widely used for converting arbitrary noise channels into Pauli channels in error threshold estimations of quantum error correction codes. It is vitally useful both in real experiments and in classical quantum simulations. Minimising the size of the twirling gate set increases the efficiency of simulations and in experiments it might reduce both the number of runs required and the circuit depth (and hence the error burden). Conventional twirling uses the full set of Pauli gates as the set of twirling gates. This article provides a theoretical background for Pauli twirling and a way to construct a twirling gate set with a number of members comparable to the size of the Pauli basis of the given error channel, which is usually much smaller than the full set of Pauli gates. We also show that twirling is equivalent to stabiliser measurements with discarded measurement results, which enables us to further reduce the size of the twirling gate set.\""

    "Twirling is a technique that has been long established in the quantum information literature. It was first used for mapping a diverse range of states into a canonical form in entanglement purification [1, 2]. Then it ap- peared again as an integral part in randomised bench- marking [3, 4] and was also used to reduce the num- ber of experimental runs needed in quantum process tomography [5, 6], both are critical in benchmarking the performance of quantum systems, especially “Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum” (NISQ) systems [7]. More recently, twirling was used as means to boost the perfor- mance of NISQ through error mitigations [8–11] in which it enables a controlled increase of the gate error rates for error extrapolations. In this article, twirling is discussed as a technique for simulating noise and the impact of the noise on the performance of quantum error correction codes [12].\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gottesman-Knill theorem [13, 14] states that any quantum circuits involving only Clifford gates can be per- fectly simulated in polynomial time on a classical com- puter. One important example is the circuits used to im- plement quantum error correction codes. For each code, there exists an error threshold of the circuit components below which the computational error can be made arbi- trarily small by scaling up the code. As we try to obtain the error thresholds of the codes, we often need to in- troduce various forms of noise into the circuits based on the underlying physical implementations. This noise can be viewed as extra probabilistic gates on top of the per- fect Clifford gates. However, the fact that this noise can be non-Clifford means that the circuits cannot be simu- lated efficiently classically, i.e. numerically determining the threshold becomes intractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be solved by twirling. Twirling means that every time we run the circuit, we conjugate the noise with an gate randomly chosen from a set of gates called the twirling set. By choosing the twirling set to be the full set of Pauli operators, we can convert any noise channel into a Pauli channel whose noise elements correspond to the Pauli basis of the original noise [15]. Such Pauli chan- nel approximation has been shown to be effective in error threshold estimation by Geller et al. [12] and Guti ́errez et al. [16], which justify its usage in error threshold simula- tion across various architectures [17–20]."

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article we will focus on Pauli twirling, whose twirling set is a subset of Pauli gates, with the goal of converting a given noise channel into a Pauli channel. For such a goal, twirling over the full set of Pauli operators is not always optimal. If we want to apply twirling in quan- tum simulations or real experiments, a twirling set with a smaller size means a lower number of simulations or experiments may be needed to get the full statistical re- sult. Moreover, a smaller twirling set allows us to choose twirling gates that have higher fidelities and/or act on fewer qubits. This will reduce the number of errors we introduce into the system due to twirling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will introduce a way to exploit the symmetries in the noise channel to reduce the size of the Pauli twirling set needed for the channel. The paper is or- ganised as follows. In Section II, we first introduce some essential concepts for our analysis. In Section III, we in- troduce the theory of Pauli twirling, in which we obtain the requirement on the twirling set. In Section IV, we show a way to construct a twirling set that satisfied the conditions that we laid out. This is followed by two exam- ples. In Section V, we discuss how to use stabiliser mea- surements to further reduce the size of our twirling set. Lastly, Section VI provides a summary of our results and some possible future directions. The mathematical justi- fication for our method of construction of the twirling set is described in the appendices, which forms an essential part of the paper."

    "## Step 7: Notes and Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensure Dependencies are Met\n",
    "\n",
    "- **useful_classes Module**: Make sure the `Paulis` and `Q_states` classes from `useful_classes` are accessible. They should either be in the same directory or installed as a package.\n",
    "- **Sympy and Numpy**: Ensure `sympy` and `numpy` are installed in your Python environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjust the Error Model as Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "- The error model is a dictionary where:\n",
    "  - **Keys**: Strings representing quantum states (e.g., `\"11\"`).\n",
    "  - **Values**: Dictionaries mapping Pauli errors to their probabilities (e.g., `{\"XX\": 0.1}`).\n",
    "- **Probabilities**: Make sure the probabilities are valid (i.e., between 0 and 1) and that they sum appropriately for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing with Different Error Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Add or modify the `error_model` in `main_script.py` to test different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    error_model = {\n",
    "        \"00\": {\"II\": 0.9, \"XX\": 0.1},\n",
    "        \"01\": {\"YY\": 0.2, \"ZZ\": 0.8},\n",
    "        \"10\": {\"XI\": 0.5, \"IX\": 0.5},\n",
    "        \"11\": {\"XX\": 0.4, \"YY\": 0.6}\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    results = twirling.run_twirling_simulation(error_model)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(\"Twirling Results:\")\n",
    "    for pauli_error, probability in results.items():\n",
    "        print(f\"{pauli_error}: {probability:.6f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `validate_kraus_operators` function checks if the Kraus operators satisfy necessary quantum channel properties.\n",
    "- If there's an issue with the error model or the operators, an exception will be raised. Be prepared to handle exceptions or adjust the error model accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you've successfully encapsulated your quantum twirling code into a module and learned how to import and use it in another project. This approach enhances code reusability and maintainability, allowing you to integrate complex functionality with ease.\n",
