# Problem Scope


Error channels observed in quantum computing aren't trivial, and in some cases, are represented by non-Clifford operators. Clifford operators, which are unitary, 
have the advantage of being easy to simulate efficiently, as Clifford error channels can be simulated in polynomial time using stabilizer techniques. In contrast, 
simulating arbitrary error channels typically scales exponentially with the size of the quantum system. Twirling quantum errors approximates complex noise 
channels as effective Pauli channels, making them computationally efficient to analyze and integrate into simulations.

In this project, we implement twirling given a state-based-error-model using the full Pauli twirling set.
