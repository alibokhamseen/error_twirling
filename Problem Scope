# Problem Scope Draft


Upon receiving a given error channel as an input (in what context?), it would be useful to decompose it into simpler components.
Such is possible with Twirling: a popular technique used in both real experiments and classical model simulations to represent the given noise input as Pauli channels.
The set of all possible Pauli matrices is called the Twirling set and minimizing it by creating and utilizing a nonunique subset is paramount in increasing the efficiency of simulations and mitigating the number of runs in experiments.
>>What is the optimal size of the twirling set and are there trade offs?
>>W is the name of the subset right?

In this project we were able to successfully generate the subset of the Twirling set and successfully performed twirling on (What?) to (do what?).
